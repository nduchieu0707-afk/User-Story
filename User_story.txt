User story:
Once upon a time, in a small town, a visionary company decided to build a new factory, which can make ecological fuel from microplastics gathered from the ocean. They had acquired a piece of land and were eager to create not just a factory, but an ecological community for their employees. In the beginning, the factory would employ twenty people: Two in management, one in marketing, five in research and development, eight factory workers, a janitor, a cleaner, and two kitchen staff.
 
The company wanted to ensure that their employees and their families would have everything they needed. So, they planned to build apartments for those who needed temporary housing. to accommodate different needs and preferences. They also planned to build a grocery store, health care, a daycare and a sports center to make the workplace attractive for families.
 
The company was committed to sustainability. They wanted work and living environments to be as ecologically sustainable as possible. They believed that a green, self-sufficient community would not only attract employees but also ensure they stayed happy and healthy.
 
The project had a tight timeline. The company aimed to have everything ready in about 12 weeks. They knew it was ambitious, but they were determined to make it happen. They believed that with careful planning and hard work, they could create a thriving, sustainable community that would be a model for others to follow.

    Planning to set up the electric lines, water pipes, and waste management areas. 
    The area will be next to the factory for the convenience of workers.
    To ensure security, the housing will be in a gated community
Development work:
    Prepare the construction site.
    Build temporary housing first.
    Install basic electricity and water systems.
Review:
    The area shouldn’t be next to the factory, it is too unhealthy to live in an environment with bad air quality → Will affect workers' performance. Suggest: Move the area into a different place which is surrounded with nature → Healthier living standard → Boost worker’s performance.
Sprint 2: Grocery Store
Planning: 
    We will apply food, appliances and electronic equipment → apply enough food for everyone in the city.
    Grocery stores will be built in many places in the city and countryside, providing people around with convenience and adequate necessities when there are grocery stores nearby.
    Plan to establish more food stalls as well as provide more necessities such as electronics and machinery for consumers.
Development Work: 
    First thing: to provide adequate food. First we need to transport tons of food and equipment to grocery stores into inhabited areas. This will fully meet the needs of consumers in places with grocery stores.
    Second thing: We should also hire storekeepers, we need two or three people to enter the grocery store to run the store in every city or countryside, enough workforce in each store can expand the chain to other places.
    Finally, to establish more stores, we need to ensure enough income to achieve high results by creating a comfortable shopping environment for everyone. When we meet those requirements, we can establish more stores in many other places as well as thereby providing more needs to consumers when we have expanded.
Review:
    Grocery stores meet the basic needs.
    Need more organic and eco-friendly food options.
    Suggest adding an automated inventory management system to reduce waste.

Planning:
    We will provide many hospitals as well as many pharmacies for surrounding people, this will ensure the health of everyone around as they do not need to travel too far to the hospital if they have any problems.
