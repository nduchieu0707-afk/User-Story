User story:
Once upon a time, in a small town, a visionary company decided to build a new factory, which can make ecological fuel from microplastics
gathered from the ocean. They had acquired a piece of land and were eager to create not just a factory, but an ecological community for
their employees. In the beginning, the factory would employ twenty people: Two in management, one in marketing, five in research and
development, eight factory workers, a janitor, a cleaner, and two kitchen staff.
 
The company wanted to ensure that their employees and their families would have everything they needed. So, they planned to build
apartments for those who needed temporary housing. to accommodate different needs and preferences. They also planned to build a grocery
store, health care, a daycare and a sports center to make the workplace attractive for families.
 
The company was committed to sustainability. They wanted work and living environments to be as ecologically sustainable as possible.
They believed that a green, self-sufficient community would not only attract employees but also ensure they stayed happy and healthy.
 
The project had a tight timeline. The company aimed to have everything ready in about 12 weeks. They knew it was ambitious, but they
were determined to make it happen. They believed that with careful planning and hard work, they could create a thriving, sustainable
community that would be a model for others to follow.

Product Backlog:

    → Accommodation
    → A grocery Store
    → Healthcare
    → Sportcenter/yoga center
    → A green environment throughout the 12 weeks

Sprint 1a: Accommodation
Planning:
    - Build temporary houses for workers → while waiting to build apartments.
    - Planning to set up the electric lines, water pipes, and waste management areas. 
    - The area will be next to the factory for the convenience of workers.
    - To ensure security, the housing will be in a gated community
Development work:
    - Prepare the construction site.
    - Build temporary housing first.
    - Install basic electricity and water systems.
Review:
    - The area shouldn’t be next to the factory, it is too unhealthy to live in an environment with bad air quality → Will affect workers'
    performance. Suggest: Move the area into a different place which is surrounded with nature → Healthier living standard → Boost worker’s
    performance.

Sprint 1b: Relocation of Accommodation 
Planning:
    - Select a new location for the housing area in a greener environment, away from factory pollution.
    - Redesign the housing layout with more eco-friendly standards.
    - Prepare legal documents for land usage and permits.
Development work:
    - Relocate planned housing to the area to the green zone.
    - Adjust construction design based on the new location.
Review:
    - The new location is healthier and meets sustainability goals.
    - Need more green energy in the construction plan.

Sprint 1c: Install green energy for accommodation
Planning:
    - Install solar panels on the rooftop of new apartments.
    - Train maintenance staff on how to operate and repair renewable energy.
Development work:
    - Receive and install solar panels from the supplier.
    - Connect solar panels to the building’s electric grid and backup storage.
Review:
    - Solar panels installed and operated successfully. 

Sprint 2a: Grocery Store
Planning: 
    - We will apply food, appliances and electronic equipment → apply enough food for everyone in the city.
    - Grocery stores will be built in many places in the city and countryside, providing people around with convenience and adequate
    necessities when there are grocery stores nearby.
    - Plan to establish more food stalls as well as provide more necessities such as electronics and machinery for consumers.
Development Work: 
    - First thing: to provide adequate food. First we need to transport tons of food and equipment to grocery stores into inhabited areas.
    This will fully meet the needs of consumers in places with grocery stores.
    - Second thing: We should also hire storekeepers, we need two or three people to enter the grocery store to run the store in every city
    or countryside, enough workforce in each store can expand the chain to other places.
    - Finally, to establish more stores, we need to ensure enough income to achieve high results by creating a comfortable shopping environment
    for everyone. When we meet those requirements, we can establish more stores in many other places as well as thereby providing more needs to
    consumers when we have expanded.
Review:
    - Grocery stores meet the basic needs.
    - Need more organic and eco-friendly food options.
    - Suggest adding an automated inventory management system to reduce waste.

Sprint 2b: Expand organic good options
Planning:
    - Add organic food, eco-friendly packaging and local locally sourced products to grocery stores.
    - Train staff on sustainability awareness.
Development work:
    - Stock grocery stores with more organic good options.
    - Launch a green marketing campaign.
Review:
    - More organic food options have appeared in grocery stores, meeting the basic needs of the customers. 

Sprint 3: Healthcare
Planning:
    - We will provide many hospitals as well as many pharmacies for surrounding people, this will ensure the health of everyone around as they
    do not need to travel too far to the hospital if they have any problems.
    - Reduce treatment costs for the elderly and children. These two groups of people will be given priority in reducing treatment costs when
    they go for medical examination, making these two groups more proactive in going for medical examination and treatment whenever they have
    health problems.
    - In addition, we need to maintain good hygiene, not causing problems related to pollution, which can help each person's health become
    healthier.
Development Work: 
    - To be able to provide more hospitals as well as pharmacies for everyone, we need to ensure that both of their incomes are sufficient or
    increased. To do that, we will encourage people to go to the doctor more when they have physical problems by offering many discounts if
    they come regularly.
    - Reducing medical examination and treatment costs for the elderly and children can both increase revenue for the hospital and thereby
    expand more facilities around while ensuring the health of these two groups of people.
    - Finally, to keep the environment clean, we should dump trash in the right place, plant many trees, and actively take public transportation
    to limit emissions from escaping into the environment.

Sprint 4a: Sportscenter / Yoga 
Planning:
    - For the support center we need to buy all the important gym machinery and some mandatory equipment like the deadlift belt .
    - We need to hire the loader truck that transfers the machinery from the store toward the sportscenter . 
    - We need to install the attendance machine through which everyone enrolled and when he join the gym their presence is recorded .
    - For Yoga we need a professional trainer and the system of enrollment also has a fixed timing so everyone can do exercises under the
    guidance of the trainer.
Develop work:
    - Install gym equipment in the center.
    - Test for safety and set up maintenance.
    - Implement attendance system with card/QR scanning.

Review:
    - New schedules and classes have attracted more participants.


Sprint 5: A green environment throughout the 12 weeks
Planning:
    - To do all of this, we will mobilize many different resources, including many skilled employees in each field to be able to manage
    everything. 
    - At the same time, we need to ensure enough fuel and materials to use during these 12 weeks, ensuring that no shortcomings occur.
Development Work: 
    - In order for everything to go smoothly, each place will have to appoint a certain number of people to work to ensure consistency in
    work when maintaining this project for 12 weeks, which requires people who can direct and manage a certain number of people so that the
    project is not delayed.
    - To be able to have enough materials, each place will have to transport a lot of fuel to be able to provide enough for each aspect such
    as groceries, pharmacies,... to ensure the project goes smoothly, creating a healthy space as well as comfort for everyone.
Review:
    - Resource mobilization is well organized with skilled employees allocated to different areas. 
    - Fuel and materials were supplied adequately for groceries, healthcares and other facilities.
