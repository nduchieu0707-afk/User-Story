Individual Task:
Scrum
Write into your project Readme:
- Observations from the project?
- What went well, what should have been done differently?
- How well did your team succeed in estimates and sprint planning?
- How was your product owner?
- What did you learn about Scrum as a project management method?
- What roles are included in Scrum projects? What tasks do these roles entail?


- When I observed the project, I found that the group members were very active and responsible for their
  work, making it possible for our group's assignments to be completed on time and completely.

- What happened best was that the progress of the process was not limited and the group
  completed the assigned exercises without any delay. What I want differently is that team members
  can interact with each other more, thereby creating efficiency in work.

- My team has been very successful in estimating and planning the sprint. Each team member knows their tasks
  and roles in the team, so they know what they need to do, thereby making the plan more solid and completed faster
  than expected.

- My owner is a picky, visionary person and can give advice as well as add to the product's plan
  to make it more complete and perfect.

- I find Scrum and this project management method to be extremely meaningful in helping me understand
  what teamwork is and how teamwork can be effective. It helps me realize that managing and planning with
  everyone is extremely important.

- Roles in a Scrum project include: Product owner, Scrum master and Dev Team.
  The Product owner requires them to come up with their own ideas so that the Scrum master and Dev team can
  adopt them and implement them to satisfy the requirements given by the Product owner. The Scrum Master is the
  person who creates the conditions for the Scrum team to operate effectively and achieve project goals quickly
  and flexibly. Finally, the dev team will develop, build, and turn ideas into real products
